## ‚ú¢ 1: Join the group on Discord and Telegram to receive my support. I sincerely apologize for the past few days, as I have been focused on completing my Flash USDT project, which caused me to miss many messages. I hope everyone can understand, and from today, I am officially back to provide support for everyone.
## ‚ú¢ 2: One of my main concerns is that Cryply Flash USDT does not fall into the wrong hands, which is the primary reason I do not want anyone to try the PRO version. There will absolutely be no trials or sending small $flash for you to test (if you don't trust me, please don't send me a message).
## ‚ú¢ 3: If you want to know what the PRO version is like, join Discord or Telegram and send me a message: Since I don't want any community benefits to be abused or used for the wrong purposes, I want to provide them EXCLUSIVELY to legitimate individuals and businesses.
## ‚ú¢ 4: Your response will help me understand your work and why you need the PRO version. This will help me decide whether to add you to the PRO user list. If you can convince me, feel free to send me a message.
